## Description

Slugging is a DC-area practice of forming impromptu carpools to take advantage of High Occupancy Vehicle lanes on the highways. Drivers pull up to various informal "slug line" spots, call out their destination and riders with a matching itinerary catch a ride - both benefit from the convenience and speed.

Sluggr was build to assist this process by allowing commuters to invite others to ride-share ahead of time, adding reliability and hopefully increasing the occurence of carpooling.

* JQuery
* Underscore
* Handlebars

## How it Works

Users create a profile with their morning and evening departure times and destinations. A list of unmatched users populates based on their home/work proximity. Users can filter the list to display drivers or riders, view detailed profiles and invite to join a carpooling group.
